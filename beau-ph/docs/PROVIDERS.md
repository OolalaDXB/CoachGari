# BEAU PH — Provider readiness matrix (V0)

Readiness is a **product** property (is the adapter implemented and onboardable?). "Enabled" is a **merchant** property. "Configured" is a **deployment** property reported by the adapter at request time (secret presence + mode). A rail is offered only when all three line up *and* the customer's country, the currency and the intent fall inside **both** the provider's coverage and the merchant's persisted configuration (`merchant_methods.countries / currencies / intents`, ISO codes; `null` = needs configuration, never "any"). The BEAU PH › Rails workspace shows the two sides separately and the checklist per rail (credentials present · webhook · merchant configuration · last provider event).

| Rail | Key | Kind | Confirmed by | Readiness | Countries | Currencies | Secrets (names only) | Coach Gari today | Owner action |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Card (Stripe) | `stripe` | online | signature-verified webhook | **available** | any | any | `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`; config `PAYMENTS_MODE` (test \| live) | implemented · enabled · merchant intended mode **live** · webhook path proven · Oolala's Stripe account (no Connect) | set `PAYMENTS_MODE=live` on Supabase (the key's mode must match, else refused); keep `SITE_URL` on the Vercel production alias until `coachgari.com` is attached |
| Aani (UAE instant payment) | `aani` | manual | authorised operator | **available** | AE | AED | none | implemented · enabled · V1 static instructions (registered mobile), manual reconciliation | none (verified QR optional later) |
| Bank transfer | `bank_transfer` | manual | authorised operator | **available** | any | any | none | implemented · **not yet configured** (no account details entered — nothing is seeded) | enter Account holder / IBAN / BIC-SWIFT / Bank name in Finance and enable |
| Paynow (Zimbabwe) | `paynow` | online | provider event | **not_configured** | ZW | USD, ZWG | `PAYNOW_INTEGRATION_ID`, `PAYNOW_INTEGRATION_KEY` | adapter boundary only — refuses to act | Paynow merchant onboarding; then V1 integration (Initiate Transaction, hash-verified result handler) |
| M-PESA (Kenya) | `mpesa` | online | provider event | **not_configured** | KE | KES | `MPESA_CONSUMER_KEY`, `MPESA_CONSUMER_SECRET`, `MPESA_SHORTCODE`, `MPESA_PASSKEY` | adapter boundary only — refuses to act | Safaricom Daraja onboarding (go-live); then V1 integration (STK push + callback verification) |
| Ozow (South Africa) | `ozow` | online | provider event | **not_configured** | ZA | ZAR | `OZOW_SITE_CODE`, `OZOW_PRIVATE_KEY`, `OZOW_API_KEY` | adapter boundary only — refuses to act | Ozow merchant onboarding; then V1 integration (hosted page, hash-verified notification) |
| PayShap (South Africa) | `payshap` | online | provider event | **not_configured** | ZA | ZAR | `PAYSHAP_SPONSOR_CLIENT_ID`, `PAYSHAP_SPONSOR_CLIENT_SECRET` | adapter boundary only — refuses to act | choose a sponsoring bank/PSP exposing PayShap request-to-pay; then V1 integration |
| BEAU Wallet | `beau_wallet` | crypto | unavailable | **placeholder** | any | any | none | visible as "coming soon"; cannot create or confirm; no static address; no client tx hash | separate approval before any implementation (see the future contract in `providers/beau-wallet/adapter.ts`) |

## In-person / SoftPOS — UAE Tap to Pay on iPhone PSPs (see `SOFTPOS.md`)

| Rail | Key | `softpos` (handoff, operator-attested) | `tap_to_pay` (native, ios_app) | `card_present` / `online_checkout` | Coach Gari today | Owner action |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Network International (N-Genius) | `network_international` | **available** via the N-Genius One app | placeholder | not onboarded | not enabled | open a Network International merchant account, enable in Finance → In-person acceptance |
| Magnati (SwipeX) | `magnati` | **available** via the SwipeX app | placeholder | not onboarded | not enabled | SwipeX digital onboarding, enable in Finance → In-person acceptance (recommended V0) |
| Adyen | `adyen` | not available (SDK-only, no standalone app) | placeholder | not onboarded | — | only relevant for the native path |

Capabilities are declared per provider (`beau_ph.provider_capabilities`); the Finance rails matrix shows them as chips. Eligibility for a capability adds **device/platform** and **initiator** to merchant × country × currency × readiness — `tap_to_pay` is offered on `ios_app` only, never from a browser/PWA; in-person capabilities are never offered on a customer page.

What "refuses to act" means, proven by `supabase/tests/beau_ph_contract.sql`: `eligible_methods` omits the rail with an explicit reason; `create_request` raises; a fabricated provider event is stored as evidence with `outcome = rejected:provider_not_configured` / `rejected:provider_cannot_confirm` and never changes a request's state.

## Manual rails — the confirmation record

For Aani and bank transfer, confirming a receipt writes: the **operator** (authenticated email), the **timestamp** (paid_at, defaults to now), the **amount** and **currency** (must equal the request's — no conversion), the **provider**, the **reference** the operator typed, an optional note — as an `operator.confirmed` provider event (verbatim payload) plus a normalized `paid` payment event with `actor = operator`. Opening or copying instructions writes nothing.

## Money paths for Coach Gari

- Stripe: Oolala collects → `recompute_earning` (commission) → Gari payable via settlements.
- Aani / bank transfer: paid straight to Gari → **no** Oolala earning row (the money never passed through Oolala's Stripe). Owner decision pending on the commercial treatment.
