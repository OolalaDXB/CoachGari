   BEAU PH provider — BEAU Wallet (crypto) — PLACEHOLDER

   BEAU (the wallet / product ecosystem) is distinct from BEAU PH (this hub).
   Inside BEAU PH the wallet is one future provider/rail. Today it is visible
   as "coming soon" and can do nothing: no request, no confirmation, no
   static wallet address shown to payers, no client-submitted transaction
   hash accepted as proof. beau_ph.providers.readiness = 'placeholder' makes
   the DB refuse create_request / ingest_provider_event for it as well.

   FUTURE CONTRACT (server-authorised crypto payment request), to implement
   only after separate approval:

     host order
       → BEAU PH payment request            (amount, fiat reference currency)
       → approved asset / network           (stablecoin-capable: e.g. USDC on an approved network)
       → BEAU Wallet deep link / QR         (bound to ONE unique request reference)
       → wallet transaction
       → verifiable confirmation            (on-chain / wallet-service attestation verified server-side)
       → normalized BEAU PH event           (beau_ph.ingest_provider_event 'beau_wallet')
       → host ledger reconciliation
